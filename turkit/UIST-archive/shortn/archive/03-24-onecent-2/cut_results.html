  <pre style="width:500px;border:thin solid; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">When I look at this picture of myself, I realize how much I've grown and changed, not only physically, but also mentally as a person in the last couple of years.  Less than one month after this photograph was taken, I arrived at Woodbridge High School in Irvine, California without any idea of what to expect.  I entered my second year of high school as an innocent thirteen year-old who was about a thousand miles from home and was a new member of not the sophomore, but "lower-middle" class.  Around me in this picture are the things which were most important in my life at the time: studying different types of cars and planes, following every move made by Tiger Woods, and seeing the latest blockbuster movies like "The Dark Knight" or "Spider Man 3."  On my t-shirt is the rest of my life -- golf. Midway through my senior year at Woodbridge High School, the focuses in my life have changed dramatically.</pre>
