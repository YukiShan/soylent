  <pre style="width:500px;border:thin solid; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">Print publishers are in a tizzy over Apple's new iPad because they hope to charge for their digital editions.  But to get people to pay for their magazine and newspaper apps, they must offer something that readers cannot get at the newsstand or free on the internet.  We've already seen plenty of prototypes from magazine publishers which include interactive graphics, photo slide shows, and embedded videos.</pre>

After all, the cover is still the gateway to the magazine.  One way these covers could change is by using a video loop for the background image instead of the print edition's static photos.  Jesse Rosten, a photographer in California, created the video mockup below of what a cover of Sunset Magazine might look like on the iPad (see video below).</pre>

He points out that these videos will have to be shot in a vertical orientation.  This is just a mockup Rosten came up with on his own, but the designers of these new magazine apps should take note.  The only way people are going to pay for these apps is if they create new experiences for readers.</pre>
