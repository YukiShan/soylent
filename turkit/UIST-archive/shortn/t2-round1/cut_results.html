  <pre style="width:500px;border:thin solid; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">The graphical user interface (GUI) has proven both a successful and durable model for human-computer interaction which has dominated the last decade of interface design.  At the same time, the GUI approach falls short in many respects, particularly in embracing the rich interface modalities between people and the physical environments they inhabit.  Systems exploring augmented reality and ubiquitous computing have begun to address this challenge.  However, these efforts have often taken the form of exporting the GUI paradigm to more world-situated devices, falling short of much of the richness of physical-space interaction they seek to augment.</pre>

In particular, we are interested in pushing back from the GUI into the real world, physically instantiating many of the metaphorical devices the GUI has popularized.  Simultaneously, we have attempted to push forward from the unaugmented physical world, inheriting from the richness of various historical instruments and devices often "obsoleted" by the advent of the computer.</pre>

  <pre style="width:500px;border:thin solid; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">In the following sections, we present our design approach towards making user interfaces tangible.  The operating scenario of the Tangible Geospace prototype is then presented.  This is followed by a description of the metaDESK implementation, including display, sensor, and software architectures. Interaction issues encountered with the prototype are then discussed, followed by future work and conclusions.</pre>
