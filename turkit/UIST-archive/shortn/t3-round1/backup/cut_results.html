Recording a fragment of text simply requires picking up a pen or typing at a keyboard.  When we enter text, each (pen or key) stroke is being used to record the actual information we care about---none is wasted on application navigation or configuration.  The linear structure of text means there's always an obvious place to put anything---at the end.  And the free form of text means we can record anything we want to about anything, without worrying whether it fits some application schema or should be split over multiple applications.  All of this means that we have to do less to record text, which makes it more efficient and also less of an interruption and distraction than using a complex application.</pre>

We present WenSo, a tool that uses lightweight text input to capture richly structured information for later retrieval and navigation in a graphical environment.  WenSo provides: 
 - entry of information by typing arbitrary scraps of text (with all the text-input benefits mentioned above) 
- inclusion of structured information in the text through a natural and extensible "pidgin" 
- extraction of structure through lightweight recognition of entities and relationships between them 
- association of automatically-measured context with the information being recorded 
- search and faceted browsing based on tags, entities, and relations for finding relevant text scraps 
- automatic routing of relevant pieces of the entered information to structured applications such as calendar, address book, and web browser so that it can be retrieved and visualized using those domain-specific tools.</pre>

In the following sections we present the related work that informs our approach, describe the interaction design and describe in our solutions for the key system implementation challenges.  We then discuss the future research opportunities both for extending the WenSo platform, but most immediately, for using the platform to determine what happens in terms of information scrap entry and reuse behaviour once these new affordances have been provided.</pre>
