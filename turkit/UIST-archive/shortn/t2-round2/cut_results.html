  <pre style="width:500px;border:thin solid; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">Our research with the metaDESK system focuses on the use of tangible objects - real physical entities which can be touched and grasped - as driving elements of human-computer interaction.  In particular, we are interested in pushing back from the GUI into the real world, physically instantiating many of the metaphorical devices the GUI has popularized.  Simultaneously, we have attempted to push forward from the unaugmented physical world, inheriting from the richness of various historical instruments and devices often "obsoleted" by the advent of the computer.</pre>
