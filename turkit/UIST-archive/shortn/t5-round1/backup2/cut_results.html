  <pre style="width:500px;border:thin solid; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">Figure 3 shows the pseudocode that implements this design for Lookup.  FAWN-DS extracts two fields from the 160-bit key: the i low order bits of the key (the index bits) and the next 15 low order bits (the key fragment).  FAWN-DS uses the index bits to select a bucket from the Hash Index, which contains 2i hash buckets.  Each bucket is only six bytes: a 15-bit key fragment, a valid bit, and a 4-byte pointer to the location in the Data Log where the full entry is stored.</pre>
