If the fragments do not match, FAWN-DS uses hash chaining to continue searching the hash table. Once it finds a matching key fragment, FAWN-DS reads the record off of the flash.  If the stored full key in the on-flash record matches the desired lookup key, the operation is complete.  Otherwise, FAWN-DS resumes its hash chaining search of the in memory hash table and searches additional records.  With the 15-bit key fragment, only 1 in 32,768 retrievals from the flash will be incorrect and require fetching an additional record.</pre>

  <pre style="width:500px;border:thin solid; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">Lookup proceeds, then, by locating a bucket using the index bits and comparing the key against the key fragment.  If the fragments do not match, FAWN-DS uses hash chaining to continue searching the hash table. Once it finds a matching key fragment, FAWN-DS reads the record off of the flash.  If the stored full key in the on-flash record matches the desired lookup key, the operation is complete.  Otherwise, FAWN-DS resumes its hash chaining search of the in memory hash table and searches additional records.  With the 15-bit key fragment, only 1 in 32,768 retrievals from the flash will be incorrect and require fetching an additional record.</pre>
